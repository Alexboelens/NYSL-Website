                        <h2>Mission</h2>
                        <p>To support young athletes living in Chicago's northside neighbourhoods, who have an interest
                            in learning and playing soccer, with opportunities to learn and practice skills related to
                            the game of soccer, specifically those skills around team cooperation and good
                            sportsmanship.</p>

                        <h2>Vision</h2>
                        <p>The Northside Youth Soccer League aspires to develop strong, well-rounded, and mindful
                            athletes through the building of character, self-discipline, and leadership.</p>

                        <h2>General Information</h2>
                        <p>The Northside Youth Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide athletes residing in
                            Chicago's northside neighbourhoods an environment in which to learn and play soccer. To be a
                            member of NYSL, you must be between the ages of 4-12 and reside in a Chicago northside
                            neighbourhood. NYSL is ran by a small full-time staff, and relies on the generous volunteer
                            time of parents and previous league members.</p>
